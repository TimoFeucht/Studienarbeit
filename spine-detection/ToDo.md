# TODO
- [ ] Using HPE to detect hip-keypoint and shoulder-keypoint to determine the ROI of the spine
- [ ] Use only ROI for further processing 
- [ ] Polynomial fitting for the spine to determine the curvature
- [ ] Test whether filtering for tshirt color is necessary, because spine should be top-left edge regardless of tshirt color
